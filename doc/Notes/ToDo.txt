7) Newick parsing very slow

8) select command for taxa/chars/blocks
	to only use a list of taxa

9) Consolidate General sequence characters in the same block with the same
	TCM.  Would have to merge alphabets and TCMs so that only need a single 
	hashMap for them 
	Would need to modify the CharacterData type to add a Vector (Vector BV.BV)
	to hold teh multiple sequenxe states like with static characters.
	Same for Matrix/Sankoff

32) Add affine cost option
	modify charInfo field for affine cost
	first arg in generateDenseTransitionCostMatrix
	0 /= 0

42) Add function to map bitvector back to alphabet states (including ambiguities)

48) Hartigan 1973 preorder optimization

52) Node clusters--Goloboff 1996,1999

71) latex structure and all that stuff on how it works + haddock functions

72) stylish and hlint source code
	hlint, stylish-haskell, remove warnings

83) Parallelize data processing

91) Text reorganiztion with matrix characters wiht different matrices

107) Graphical profiling

	profiteur phyg.prof (from +RTS -p after --enable-profiling)
	xdg-open phyg.prof.html

	^C only 1 time to get prof info if not complete

108) read distance?
	name, data issues etc.
	if null data could just return distance costs
	used for image data as well--as with other chracter types.

123) add single assignment and singal assignment edge weights
	Can be added later if needed for outpu display or lengths
	or could use average of min and max as a placeholder for now

130) Return Bridge set Tarjan linear 
	GraphAlgorithmBook.pdf
	https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bridge-in-a-graph/
	Popcount for size subtree

143) Check optimization for input forest
	issues with rootindex
	need to make more flexible so can just map over components
	perhaps splitgraph/merge graph type thing to keep root index as nOTUs
	perhaps remove to an added option to break on "long" edges at with
	separate functions

144) Check optimization for multirooted components

166) make forest a final set deleting edges?

177) remove calls to getRoots  must be O(n)

180) Check size of (number of) resolutions, that its not blowing up
	-- put limit

186) Graph distance matrix output RF, SPR, TBR, net+SPR/TBR

187) create incremental postorder pass for use in wagern and swapping
	add damping if possible

219) remove all the parent child stuff from vertex--never used, rely on grpah functions

261) change fmap blah $ fmap beh to fmap (blah . bleh)

272) net move--no need to reoptimize everyhting in delete step

283) Try adding in reroot traversal for hardwired
	--currently disabled

318) write small adjunct program to filter out constant/uninformative charaters fomr simple tnt files.

323) Rationalize V.fromList and V.toList in bitpacking
	prob unncesesary back and forth
     	
325) efficiently parallleize bitpacking 
	paralleize bitpacking-- with option to turn off for memory saving

344) Should probably make packedData unboxed

347) maybe have a size limit for parallel bitpacking--as in over 100k (tax * chars) or something
	e.g. genomes

356) make processing data sequential for big data sets as option?
	combining and packing

372) Boostrap/Jackknife output--collapse < 50%

380) heursitic add/delete deltas need to be completely rethought--always negative
	removed for now

381) extractDisplayTrees seems to be caled multiple times in softwired for given graph

383) remove recursiveRerootList'

385) Clean up reroot code to remove (or mothball) rerooting graphs

388) Idenitify cause of dup edges
	-- bad edge insert?
	-- error in resolution cache?
	-- bad resolution of display graph
	
389) Remove duplicate /cylic checking outside of creation of display trees and charcaters trees

395) Remove cycle check from convertGeneralGraphToPhylogeneticGraph when ok

403) Clean up max distance thing --may set in types.h becasue of 2x distance

415) IA seems to be underestimating graph costs--could be that the cost matrix not being tracked in transform? sg2t1.mat in charWag.pg?

424) Make surea affine works for slim

425) Add 3, 6-7 state bit pack 
428) Check presligned hard-wired 3-way in makeIAFinalCharacter

429) Sectorial based on final states?

434) Check static approx for hugeseqs cost going down initially when it shoudl stay the same

435) Warning irrelevant options

439) Check if duplicate edges check is still needed PostOrderSoftWiredFunctions.hs l 272

444) Make sure support fully parallelized

445) check for malfomed networks in support and LG.nodesAndEdgesAfter  check on split graph

452) Affine and IP for slim

453) Make tnt char weight work with negative wqeights-- or perhaps add "\" for negative weights (versus "/")"

473) Add Moilannen recombination.  Different and intersting method (Moilanen 1999, fig 1.)

483) Look into branch lengths at root--suspiciously long

484) Branch-delete forest (PMDL)
