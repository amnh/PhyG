The `PhyG` package exposes the `phyg` executable and the `PhyG` sub-libraries.

## `phyg`

Phylogenetic Graph (PhyG) is a multi-platform program designed to produce phylogenetic graphs from input data and graphs via heuristic searching of general phylogenetic graph space.
The bio-informatics framework libraries of the broader [Phylogenetic Haskell Analytic Network Engine (PHANE) project][GitHub-PHANE-Readme] are the foundation upon which PhyG is constructed.
PhyG offers vast functionality, including the optimization of unaligned sequences, and the ability to implement search strategies such as random addition sequence, swapping, and tree fusing.
Furthermore, PhyG can generate outputs in the form of implied alignments and graphical representations of cladograms and graphs.
What sets PhyG apart from other phylogenetic analysis programs, is the extension to broader classes of input data and phylogenetic graphs.
The phylogenetic graph inputs and outputs of PhyG include trees, as well as softwired and hardwired networks.
