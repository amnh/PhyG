	\section{Introduction}
	This document contains descriptions of algorithms, procedures, data structures and other aspects of the 
	source code documentation for the program PhylogeneticGraph (\texttt{PhyG}).  
	
	 \texttt{PhyG} is a sucessor program to \texttt{POY} \citep{POY2,POY3,POY4,Varonetal2010,POY5, Wheeleretal2015} \url{https://github.com/wardwheeler/POY5}, 
	 although a ``complete'' Haskell rewrite, optimized C (and even some assembler) was ported over from POY for pairwise alignment of small alphabet (<8)
	 sequences.  These functions are access via the Haskell FFI.

	\section{Post-Order Graph Traversal}
		\subsection{Trees}
		A decorated Graph (tree) is created for each character for each block for the graph.  For exact characters, where no addition traversals are required, 
		the specified or default
		outgroup sets the direction of the graph.  For non-exact (e.g. sequence) characters the best traversal rooting is stored for each character in each block
		although the cost of the graph is recalculated based on the best traversal (over all edges in the graph), the preliminary (post-order) states are not propagated back
		to the decorated graph (third field of phylogenetic graph).  After the pre-order pass, the final states are propagated back.
		Vertices are not renumbered during the rerooting process, so indices remain unchanged.
	
	\section{Pre-Order Graph Traversal}
		\subsection{Trees}
		Final state assignments of root vertices are set to the preliminary, post-order state.
		Final  states are propagated back to the decorated graph (third field of phylogenetic graph).
		Vertices are not renumbered during the rerooting process, so indices remain unchanged.

	\subsection{Execution in Parallel}
	By default the program will execute using a single process core.  By specifying the options `+RTS -NX -RTS' where `X' is the number of processors offered to the program. These are specified after the program as in (for 4 parallel threads):\\
	\\
	PhyGraph +RTS -N4 -RTS other options...  \\
	
	Parallel code options are set using a parmap-type strategy throughout the code.  The basic definitions of this functionality are found in ParallelUtilities.hs
