Version 1.3 Release notes

New Features:
	Network edit refinement options : level, multitraverse:True/False
	Support MaxParallel option default set to "True"

Enhancements:
	Reduced time complexity of network edit heuristics
	Improved behavior of Bootstrap support calculation
	Improved network add and delete heuristics
	
Bug Fixes:
	Fixed issue in Swap where only best graph was being swapped when multiple graphs are present
	Fixed error in TNT ouput for Implied Alignemnts when "#" are present in partitioned sequences
	Fixed issue with transforming outgroup with upper case letters


Version 1.2 Release Notes

New Features:
	Added global "keep" option for equally costly graphs (can be modified lcoally for search options e.g. swap) 
	Swap options : level, multitraverse:True/False, 
	Support options to swapping component of Jackknife and Bootstrap (level) similar to "swap"
	Fuse and Support MaxParallel option to increase use of parallel resources, but reduces memory footprint by default
	Added wildcards (*,?) to rename command
	Fuse option: multitraverse:True/False

Enhancements:
	Reduced time complexity of network addition heuristics
	Reduced time complexity of Goodman-Bremer support values
	Improved behavior of swap(alternate)
	Improved performance of fuse
	Reduced default memory footprint of fuse
	
Bug Fixes:
	Fixed issue in naive/exhaustive soft-wired network optimization procedure
	Fixed issue in Goodman-Bremer sample option
	Fixed issue with pdf graph output on MacOS--requires installation of Cairo renderer and upgrade of Graphviz
	Changed option "reportNaive" to "reportNaiveData"
	Fixed issue in "report(search)"
	Fixed issue in dot/graphviz file parseing that only read first graph if multiple present
	Fixed issue in random fuse pair selection
	Fixed issue in "select" where graphs were topologically identical but had distinct roots
